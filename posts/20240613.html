		<p>"Ahhh, the world of sports. The stadiums, the huge crowds and havin' a few beers with your mates." -Joseppi</p>
		<p>Although I'm not a huge sports-fan, I still like to watch some American Football and Racing. But today I want to talk about the capitalistic greed of sports.</p>
		
		<h2>Capitalistic greed?</h2>
		<p>Yes, capitalism and greed! In the last few years I noticed, that many ways to watch any sport event, is to either buy a ticket to visit it, or via subscribing to some streaming service. I wonder why? Now, don't get me wrong. The people behind the sport need to make some money, but that can't be the right way! Even if I pay for a subscription, I sometimes still get many ads. For example: I'm in germany, so when I want to watch the NFL, I need to pay for DAZN. When I do this, I only get the US-American broadcast. Therefore I get all the ads in that broadcast. Meaning, I not only pay $50/Month, I also need to watch ads!</p>
		<h2>Why it sucks!</h2>
		<p>"back in the day" we were able to watch most sports in Free-TV. Actually I think you can watch NFL on Free-TV in the U.S. Anyhow, basically all sports I want to watch, I need to pay for a subscription service. I mean, if they managed to get enough profit with just the ads, I don't understand why they need you to pay now too (except greed). Currently I barely watch any sports, due to the broadcasters cahrging huge amounts of money. I really miss the days of turning on the TV and being able to watch what you like without any internet connection, nor any monthly plans. This is kinda like free software, I hate paying for software. But this is sports, not software, it's video material, probably worth millions. Anyways I think it should be "free with ads", or "payed without ads". But currently you only get "paid with ads"... </p>

		<h2>Other Examples</h2>
		<p>Another good example is 24h Le Mans. The FIA charges ~$30 for just the race. I don't wanna pay $30 to just watch a race live. So I personally just wait for the highlights to watch on Youtube. The whole Formula universe is the same story. The FIA only provides it on Sky or some other streaming services. Therefore I only watch the highlights there too.</p>

		<h2>A good Example</h2>
		<p>A good example of this whole capitalism drama is GT(3). I do watch GT3 sometimes, and it's freely accesible on Youtube. I love it, just go on Youtube and watch the live stream. YES! It's even live, not just a replay or highlights, the real thing!</p>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>I really hope more sporting events will adapt the "old" or the "Youtube" way. Sports is pretty cool, but the way that is required to watch it, just, suuuucks...</p>

		<br>
		<p>Hope y'all have a great day!</p>
